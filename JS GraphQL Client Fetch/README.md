#  JS GraphQL Client Fetch


A vanilla javascript app which showcases client-side fetching of data from a GraphQL API. 

The API used is https://countries.trevorblades.com which provides a list of continents and countries which can be sorted based on different parameters.

The app has a dropdown which is populated from a fetch request to the API's continents, then a list is shown with a further fetch of all countries which have the continent's ID as a property.
