Still a work in progress - a demo/playground used to learn more about querying and GraphQL in genral.

## This repo contains the following projects:

## C# GraphQL ZeroQL
A simple app which uses the ZeroQL Library to create a GraphQL Server and Client. It showcases different schemas and queries.

A vanilla JS app which uses the fetch method to get different data from a GraphQL API. The API used is https://countries.trevorblades.com which provides a list of continents and countries which can be sorted based on different parameters.
